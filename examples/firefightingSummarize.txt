# Initial conditions
Env starts with false
Robot starts in porch with false

# Assumptions about the environment

If you were in porch then do not hazardous_item
If you were in porch then do not person

#If one of these assumptions dissapear the system will be unrealizable
#In LTL these assumptions are:
#If you were in porch then do not hazardous_item -> G( (( ((!bit0 & !bit1 & !bit2)) ) ) -> (   !  X(hazardous_item))) 
#If you were in porch then do not person -> G((( ((!bit0 & !bit1 & !bit2)) ) ) -> (   !  X(person)) )

# Define robot safety including how to pick up
Do pick_up if and only if you are sensing hazardous_item and you are not activating carrying_item
If you are activating pick_up then stay there
carrying_item is set on pick_up and reset on drop
Do drop if and only if you are in porch and you are activating carrying_item

If you did not activate carrying_item then always not porch

# Define when and how to radio
Do radio if and only if you are sensing person
If you are activating radio or you were activating radio then stay there

# Patrol goals
Group rooms is living, bedroom, deck, kitchen, dining
If you are not activating carrying_item and you are not activating radio then visit all rooms
if you are activating carrying_item and you are not activating radio then visit porch
